Some cheaty automation scripts for West of Loathing

This is some simple scripts I wrote to automate a single battle against El Vibrato drones, and to trade the scraps in for sellable broaches. You'll have to modify the cursor position (autowol.py line 33) if you don't have the EXACT set of abilities I did.

A little bit more info and screenshots are in the reddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/westofloathing/comments/6xd9mm/i_automated_a_single_fight_lets_see_how_much_xp_i/

Requirements:
* Python 2.7
* pyautogui
* python for windows extensions (pywin32)
